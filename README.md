## Photo Tab Firefox Extension

I built this because I loved the [Tab Pics](http://tab.pics/) Chrome extension but migrated off Chrome due to privacy concerns. It's my first Firefox extension so it may not be that well-designed but works for me.

## How To Install

The easiest way is to use the official Add-on registry:
